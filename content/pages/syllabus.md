## Course Description

This subject offers an introduction to the history of gender, sex, and sexuality in the modern United States, focusing on the period spanning from the end of the nineteenth century to the beginning of the twenty-first. It begins with an overview of historical approaches to the field, emphasizing the changing nature of sexual and gender identities over time. The remainder of the course flows chronologically, tracing the expanding and contracting nature of attempts to control, construct, and contain sexual and gender identities—and the efforts of those who worked to resist, reject, and reimagine the meanings and lived experiences of sex, sexuality, and gender.

## Graded Assignments

This subject is conducted as a discussion-based seminar. Students should complete all assigned reading, and view any assigned films, before our class meets each week. Each student’s course participation grade is calculated according to the following formula: active and engaged participation during class sessions (20% of overall course grade); weekly participation on the course discussion forum (10% of overall course grade).

Students write two one-page response papers over the course of the term. (Students may choose which weeks to do so, but must submit at least one response paper by Session 6.) These responses should provide thoughtful analysis of weekly assigned materials and are due by 5 p.m. on the day class meets. More information about response papers will be provided at the start of the term.

In addition to these brief response papers, each student (as a part of a group) will be responsible for launching and moderating one weekly forum discussion, writing one short (1,000–1,500 word) paper, and producing one final paper or project. There will be no midterm or final exam in this course.

Further information on papers and projects can be found in the {{% resource_link "b9875dd2-ab21-4e44-a477-a3dc61c1e054" "Assignments" %}} section.

## Resources and Policies

*Attendance and Participatio*n

Attendance for this subject is mandatory except in cases of illness, religious observance, or personal or familial emergencies. Absences from class will be handled on a case-by-case basis. If you have questions regarding attendance or think you will need to miss class for any reason, please contact me as far in advance as possible. The participation grade, worth 30% of the total grade for the course, is based on student contributions to conversations both in class and on the course discussion forum. To receive full credit for in-class participation, students should arrive on time, having completed all assigned materials, and having prepared to discuss them. To receive full credit for participation on the course discussion forum, students should post at least one thoughtful comment a week.

*Note on Content*

Over the course of the semester we will discuss events and concepts that may be disturbing or traumatizing to some students. Please read the syllabus closely before the start of the term. If you suspect that specific material is likely to cause distress, I will be happy to discuss any concerns you may have before the topic comes up in class.

*Cheating and Plagiarism*

MIT has strict policies concerning plagiarism. In academic writing, it is considered plagiarism to use any idea or any language from someone else without adequately crediting that source. It doesn’t matter if the source is a published author, a website without clear authorship, a generative AI, or another student. Taking credit for work that is not one’s own is unacceptable in all academic situations, whether you do it intentionally or by accident. Many cases of plagiarism are not intentional, and instead arise out of confusion concerning what counts as plagiarism and how to avoid it. To protect yourself from accidentally becoming a plagiarist, and to learn more about what constitutes plagiarism, visit [Academic Integrity at MIT: A Handbook for Students](http://integrity.mit.edu/) or contact me directly.

*Writing Assistance*

The [Writing and Communication Center (WCC)](https://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center/) offers free professional advice from lecturers who are published writers and experienced teachers. The WCC offers help with all forms of academic, creative, and professional writing—including papers, applications, and theses. They also offer oral presentation assistance and help with English as Second Language questions.
