Over the course of the semester you (along with a group of other students) will be responsible for leading and     
moderating one conversation on the course discussion forum. You will have some say regarding which week     
you take on this role—I will ask everyone to list first, second, and third choices.

This assignment is worth 15% of your overall course grade and has three components:

**1) Posting Discussion Threads:** Forum moderators should post 2–3 discussion questions on a course topic by Thursday at 7:00 p.m. on the week before we meet to discuss that topic.

Each discussion thread should reference assigned materials for the week in question. You may choose in one thread to focus on a single reading or film. Selecting a particularly interesting, revealing, or confusing quote (and asking the class a specific question about it) is often a good way to launch a discussion. Comparing and contrasting the arguments or perspectives presented in different assigned texts is another strategy for launching discussion. (This can be especially fruitful when arguments presented in one assigned text contradict or challenge the claims of another.) A final strategy for generating discussion involves assessing assigned materials from the week as a whole. If you go this route, remember to be specific and mention individual readings in your post.

**2) Moderating Discussion:** Once you have posted your discussion threads, you will be responsible for moderating the forum. You do not need to respond to every post from your classmates. You should, however, check the forum several times to encourage and respond to your classmates, to clarify your questions if necessary, and to keep the conversation going and on track.

**3) Summarizing Forum Activity in a Brief In-Class Report:** On the day we meet in class to discuss the materials you have been assigned, you will be responsible for briefly summarizing forum activity from the week. This summary should note highlights from forum conversations, including key points of agreement or disagreement, as well as any new questions raised in discussions.

This assignment will be graded according to the following criteria:

*The quality, clarity, and insightfulness of questions posted on the forum*

- Are the questions posted by the moderator broad enough to lead to thoughtful discussion?
- Are they specific enough to invite close readings of course materials?

*The breadth and depth of the discussion*

- Has the forum moderator woven assigned materials into their discussion?
- Have they helped generate in-depth examination of major themes and ideas for the week?

*The extent to which the moderator aids in producing an inclusive and thoughtful discussion*

- Has the moderator encouraged conversation by allowing time for discussion to develop and take   
    shape?
- Have they stepped in when necessary to keep the conversation on track?
- Have they encouraged participation and interacted respectfully with other students?
